## Run ORCA with DELPHES
The project uses a [synthetic particle physics dataset](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01187-8) simulating the data stream at the Level 1 Trigger at CMS (CERN). An embedding trained using *contrastive learning* with a variational autoencoder (https://github.com/katyagovorkova/cl-orca/tree/main/cl/cl) is compared to the direct input. Two different sized fully-connected models are considered.
### In order to run from direct input
+ `python orca_delphes.py --dataset background_with_signal_cvae --size large --labeled-num 4 --milestones 10 20 --epochs 30 --batch-size 1024`
+ `python orca_delphes.py --dataset background_with_signal_cvae --size simple --labeled-num 4 --milestones 10 20 --epochs 30 --batch-size 1024`
### In order to run from embedding input
+ `python orca_delphes.py --dataset background_with_signal_cvae_latent --size large --labeled-num 4 --milestones 10 20 --epochs 30 --batch-size 1024`
+ `python orca_delphes.py --dataset background_with_signal_cvae_latent --size simple --labeled-num 4 --milestones 10 20 --epochs 30 --batch-size 1024`
