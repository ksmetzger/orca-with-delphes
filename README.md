## Run ORCA with DELPHES
Use weights `model_manual.pth` from https://github.com/katyagovorkova/cl4ad/blob/main/src/cl/models.py as pretraining by freezing the first two layers of the model `autoencoder.py`.
The delphes dataset is normalized by pT scaling [normalization](https://github.com/katyagovorkova/cl4ad/blob/d0a9095a8c4f86a8b55fa66638d11de153ee489d/src/data_preprocessing.py#L46).
### In order to run
+ `python orca_delphes.py --dataset background_with_signal_cvae --labeled-num 4`
